    "7. Parameterization: Functions can take input parameters, allowing you to create flexible and customizable solutions. \n",
    "8. Collaboration: When working on a larger project, functions allow multiple developers to work on different parts of the code simultaneously, knowing that they are interacting with well-defined interfaces.\n",
    "9. Libraries and Modules: In Python, functions can be grouped into libraries and modules, which can be imported and used in other programs. \n"

In Python, defining a function involves creating a blueprint or template for a specific set of instructions, but those instructions are executed only when the function is invoked (called) during the runtime of the program."

    "   A function is a block of code that performs a specific task or set of tasks. It encapsulates a series of instructions that can be executed whenever the function is called. Functions are defined using the `def` statement, and they can have parameters (inputs) and a return value (output). Functions provide modularity, code reusability, and abstraction.\n",
    "2. Function Call:\n",
    "   A function call (also known as invoking a function) is the action of actually using the function that you have defined. It involves providing the necessary arguments (inputs) to the function, which are then used to execute the code within the function body. When a function is called, the program jumps to the function's definition, executes its code, and returns the result (if applicable) back to the caller.\n"
